The objective of this program is to gather emails, subdomains, hosts, employee names, open ports and banners from different public sources like search engines, PGP key servers and SHODAN computer database.

This tool is intended to help Penetration testers in the early stages of the penetration test in order to understand the customer footprint on the Internet. It is also useful for anyone that wants to know what an attacker can see about their organization.

This is a complete rewrite of the tool with new features like:

  * Time delays between request
  * All sources search
  * Virtual host verifier
  * Active enumeration (DNS enumeration, Reverse lookups, TLD expansion)
  * Integration with SHODAN computer database, to get the open ports and banners
  * Save to XML and HTML
  * Basic graph with stats
  * New sources
